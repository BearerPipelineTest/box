Fork of the unmaintained [box2 project][box2]. This project needs your help!

Upgrading from [Box2][box2]? Checkout the [upgrade guide](UPGRADE.md#from-27-to-30)!

## Goal

The Box application simplifies the PHAR building process. Out of the box (no pun intended), the application can do many
great things:

- ‚ö°  Fast application bundling
- üî® [PHAR isolation](doc/code-isolation.md#phar-code-isolation)
- ‚öôÔ∏è Zero configuration by default
- üöî [Requirements checker](doc/requirement-checker.md#requirements-checker)
- üö® Friendly error logging experience 
- üîç Retrieve information about the PHAR extension or a PHAR file and its contents (`box info` or `box diff`)
- üîêÔ∏è Verify the signature of an existing PHAR (`box verify`)
- üìù Use Git tags and short commit hashes for versioning
- üïµÔ∏èÔ∏è Get recommendations and warnings about regarding your configuration (`box validate`)
- üê≥ [Docker support (`box docker`)](doc/docker.md#docker-support)


## Documentation

For the full documentation see https://box-project.github.io/box

## Usage

Creating a PHAR should be as simple as running `box compile` (**no config required!**). It will however assume some
defaults that you might want to change. Box will by default be looking in order for the files `box.json` and
`box.json.dist` in the current working directory. A basic configuration could be for example changing the PHAR
permissions:

```json
{
    "chmod": "0700"
}
```

You can then find more advanced configuration settings in [the configuration documentation][configuration].
For more information on which command or options is available, you can run:

```
box help
```


## Contributing

The project provides a `Makefile` in which the most common commands have been registered such as fixing the coding
style or running the test.

```bash
make
```


## Backward Compatibility Promise (BCP)

The policy is for the major part following the same as [Symfony's one][symfony-bc-policy]. Note that the code marked
as `@private` or `@internal` are excluded from the BCP. 

The text displayed by the commands (e.g. `compile` or `info`) or the content of the error/exception messages are also not subject to the BCP.
